# MacOS Toggle Display Desktop Items
I don't know if you have come across similar scenarios where you are asked to display your screen during the meeting, but your desktop simply has too many private files and directories that you don't want to share.

At the beginning, I believe there must be a toggle somewhere in the MacOS's settings since this is supposed to be common for many MacOS users. But I still have not yet found it...

Therefore, I write an AppleScript to add this missing feature and make it one click away.

# MacOS Toggle Display Desktop Items

## Intro

I don't know if you have come across similar scenarios where you are asked to display your screen during the meeting, but your desktop simply has too many private files and directories that you don't want to share.

At the beginning, I believe there must be a toggle somewhere in the MacOS's settings since this is supposed to be common for many MacOS users. But I still have not yet found it...

Therefore, I write an AppleScript to add this missing feature and make it one click away.

## How to install

Simply download the zip file on the Releases page, and unzip the `ToggleItems.app` file. You can keep the `ToggleItems.app` anywhere you want and whenever you want to hide your desktop items, just <u>double-click</u> the app to run it. 

>  Run it again will bring your desktop items back.

## Misc.

You like this project, please don't hesitate to give it a star. Cheers~
